# high-school-analysis
Analysing NYC high school data, published by the NYC open data. First, I have cleaned up the data to and made some correlations between the race and the sat scores. The goal was to see, whether SAT is a fare test in New York

The analysis was written in Jupyter Notebook Python and the main source code can be found in 'Schools.ipynb'. 

The link to the data is here:

And the link to the columns description of that data can be found here:

Please note, that in order to see wether SAT is fare for all students in New York, further analysis is needed. As the data has been already cleaned into 'combined' dataframe, it will be easier to do so.
